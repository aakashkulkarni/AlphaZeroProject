Author: Aakash Kulkarni
Purpose: Personal Project
```
This repository holds the source code written mostly in Python for my Alpha Zero project. It uses a neural network trained on game data to make strategic decisions. It uses the AlphaZero framework defined under Monte Carlo Tree Search to apply the neural network to a variety of games such as TicTacToe, Connect Four, and Chess.

This is based on Google's AlphaGo and AlphaZero models, however it's much simpler and uses PyTorch API to create the models.

### Concepts Learned
1. Using PyTorch library in Python to define a simple feed-forward neural network
2. Implementing TicTacToe from scratch and allowing computer to play itself
3. Implementing Monte Carlo Tree Search recursively and integrating it with a game module

### Functionality implemented
1. Monte Carlo Tree Search
2. Ability to play TicTacToe Game on terminal
3. Allowing computer to play itself
4. Playing TicTacToe strategically using MCTS and AlphaZero

### Features to implement
1. Game of chess
2. AlphaZero implementation for chess
