# AlphaZeroProject
This repository holds the source code written mostly in Python for my Alpha Zero project. It uses a neural network trained on game data to make strategic decisions. It uses the AlphaZero framework defined under Monte Carlo Tree Search to apply the neural network to a variety of games such as TicTacToe, Connect Four, and Chess.
